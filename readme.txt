README - Jacob Moseley

I have used jQuery on the views/bookings/index page. However, this jQuery will only work if the page is refreshed, I know it's not great but as its
reliant on the controller its the only way I could get it to work. So if its not apparent right away, the page may need a refresh then it will work
as expected.

The database has been seeded with an admin account, so that the the room/new partial can be accessed, as well as the admin panel. The three standard rooms
that a user can choose from are also seeded, and rooms can be added either from the form or the admin panel. I do have tests in place to ensure that
a regular user cannot add/remove/edit rooms.

Strings are held in en.yml.
